<!--
Many coders put "index.html" as the default filename for the home page of a website. This is because "index.html" is a standard filename used by web servers to serve as the default page for a directory.
When a user navigates to a website, the web server looks for a default page to display. By convention, the server will first look for a file named "index.html" in the directory that corresponds to the URL 
that the user entered. If such a file exists, the server will display its content as the default page.
Using "index.html" as the default filename has become a convention in web development, and many tools and frameworks assume that this file will be present. However, it is possible to use a different filename 
as the default page by configuring the web server or using a different framework.

But you can put another name, this is not a problem
